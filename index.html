            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="indent">My name is Danielle Korosec, and I was born in Colorado and have lived here all my life except for one year when I was 10 years old.  I lived in Texas and then moved right back with my parents.  I have an incredible family, though not without dysfunction.  I have a half brother who is 10 years younger than me on my mom’s side and a half brother who is 20 years younger than me on my father’s side.  I have been very lucky to be surrounded by loving and caring people, including having amazing friends, most of which I have had since Elementary school. I have been married for 20 years and have twins, a boy, and a girl.  They are graduating high school this year and are about to be 18 years old.   I was an athlete when I was younger until I graduated High School.  I was on the basketball team, played soccer, volleyball, but my two favorite sports were softball and swimming on the swim team.   I did earn a scholarship for softball, but it was to Colby Kansas, a town with only one stop light and no Taco Bell.  I declined at the time and realized I really wasn’t good enough or dedicated enough to go on to play college sports.  However, I still enjoy remaining active mostly in the form of walking my dog for an hour each day.  I have bouts of going to the gym, but unfortunately haven’t been consistent in that endeavor.   </p>

                    <h2>Personal life</h2>
                    <p class="indent">Family is very important to me, and I am so grateful to have such an amazing one.  My mother, my aunt, my in-laws, and grandfather come to our home once a week and have dinner with my husband, children, and myself.  We trade off cooking which is fun to try different types of meals.  We have my dad over every Sunday for dinner.  He had a stroke around 6 years ago and is paralyzed and unable to speak, but I see how much he loves my kids and loves to come over for dinner.  His eyes light up every time he sees them.    I love my dog and am grateful that I get to work from home to be with him and take him for walks every day.  He often lays behind me on his blanket when I work. I am not religious, but spiritual.  I believe in connection with other people and nature.  I am very interested in Quantum Physics and how it applies to mental health and human behavior, though I frequently don’t have the intellectual capacity to understand a lot of it.  I believe in the power of kindness and compassion.  I also strive to create and live a meaningful and purposeful life.  One of my main purposes has been to be of service to others and use my skills to help those in need.  I have learned so much from the many clients that I have worked with and admire each and everyone of them.  </p>
